The primary objective of our project, was to design and create a small scale, portable plug and play small scale 3D model scanner. The motivation to create this stems fromour personal interest in 3D printing and miniature models. This paper outlines the steps taken to achieve our goal, discussing different aspects such as the requirements, mechanics, electronics and software used. The results present a successfully designed and executed 3D scanner that was able to scan and reproduce a 3D object.


# How to run 

1. Upload the code into the Arduino using Arduino IDE
2. Turn on "Camera app" on your device
3. Use buttons on the 3DScanner to set the initial scanning position. Adjust the distance to focus on the object
4. Turn off the "camera app"
5. Turn on the camera.py scrpit. Run this in CMD with admin permissions
6. Press the start button on 3D Scanner
7. Verify that the machine starts to move and images are being saved into folder where camera.py script is being saved. 
8. Wait until the 3D Scanner finishes - approx. 8,5 min
