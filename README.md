# 3DScanner
Final project for HTMAA 2024 

The primary objective of our project, was to design and
create a small scale, portable plug and play small scale 3D
model scanner. The motivation to create this stems from
our personal interest in 3D printing and miniature models.
This paper outlines the steps taken to achieve our goal,
discussing different aspects such as the requirements, me-
chanics, electronics and software used. The results present
a successfully designed and executed 3D scanner that was
able to scan and reproduce a 3D object.
